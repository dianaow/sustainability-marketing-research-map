Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes| we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity| and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance| we argue that this green-feminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that| accordingly| consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further| men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity| as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together| these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype| gender identity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors. © 2016.

We question the robustness of this assumption and identify scenarios in which sustainability is likely to have the opposite effect| strengthening rather than weakening consumers' product performance beliefs. Specifically| we argue that sustainability is likely to produce a halo effect able to attenuate and even override the negative impact of compensatory inferences underlying consumers' belief that sustainability comes at the expense of performance. We propose that this halo effect stems from consumers' view of the company as a moral agent engaged in a prosocial behavior. In this context| we identify two factors that are likely to influence the strength of the halo effect: the degree to which consumers view the company as a moral agent whose actions aim to benefit society and the degree to which moral concerns are prominent in consumers' minds. Following this line of reasoning| we identify two ways in which managers can increase the perceived performance of sustainable products: by associating sustainable benefits with the company rather than with its products and by emphasizing the societal benefits of sustainability. We test these predictions in a series of four empirical studies that show convergent evidence for our theorizing. Our findings have important public policy implications| documenting actionable strategies that managers can use to mitigate the potential negative impact of sustainability and strengthen the perceived performance of sustainable products. © 2020 Society for Consumer Psychology,1,Corporate social responsibility; Green marketing; Inferences; Sustainable behavior,

This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data| the authors provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast| media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase. They provide implications for theory and practice and call for future research that examines the causal impact of media in general on consumer decisions| especially in domains that are crucial for the society. © American Marketing Association 2019.,1,climate change; global warming; hybrid vehicle; media; social marketing; sustainability,

Supporting this hypothesis| our first experiment shows that consumers used more paper while evaluating a pair of scissors when the option to recycle was provided (vs. not provided). In a follow-up field experiment| we find that the per person restroom paper hand towel usage increased after the introduction of a recycling bin compared to when a recycling option was not available.

Three studies provide support for our basic assertion that| compared to an intrinsic appeal| joint appeals (i.e.| an intrinsic and extrinsic appeal together) reduce consumer preference for sustainable products. As well| these studies demonstrate that this adverse effect of joint appeals is based on a lowering of consumers’ attributions of the company's sustainability efforts to intrinsic motives (e.g.| to the company's genuine concern for the environment). Finally| not all consumers react adversely to joint appeals; relative to intrinsic appeals| such appeals increase| rather than decrease| the intrinsic attributions and sustainable product preferences for consumers with lower involvement with sustainable consumption. © 2018 Society for Consumer Psychology,1,Intrinsic attributions; Message appeals; Sustainable consumption involvement; Sustainable products,

We test three main hypotheses developed from signaling theory and the sustainability reporting literature on a large panel of reporting and non-reporting organizations for the period 2011–2020. The results of a fixed effects panel model suggest that| in general| sustainability reporting is negatively related to Tobin’s q. However| the results also indicate that the relationship between sustainability reporting and Tobin’s q becomes increasingly positive over time. Our conclusion is that sustainability reporting is initially a costly signal| but that it eventually enhances firm value as companies learn how to better communicate sustainability initiatives to stakeholders and investors learn how to properly evaluate reports. Finally| in an analysis of sustainability reporting organizations| we find that external assurance is positively associated with Tobin’s q. External audits appear to increase the credibility of reports.

The downside| however| is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2| analysis of data from the J.D. PowerGuest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e.| compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that| compared with no incentive| an ""other-benefiting"" incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4| however| suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e.| providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options)maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups-the ideal outcome for managers. © 2016| American Marketing Association.",1,Green marketing; Services marketing; Social norms; Sustainability; Warm glow,

These retailers argue that their sustainability mandates may translate into profits for suppliers| but many suppliers are cynical about these mandates because the onus to undertake the required investments is on them while potential gains may be usurped by the mandating retailer. We examine whether supplier fears are justified by studying the impact of Walmart's sustainability mandate on its suppliers' (short-term) shareholder value. Although about two-thirds of suppliers are indeed financially harmed| approximately one-third benefit. To delve deeper into this variation| we relate suppliers' short-term abnormal returns to Walmart's appropriation power and explore whether and to what extent a supplier's referent and expert power sources| derived from its marketing and operational characteristics| respectively| can counteract Walmart's appropriation attempts. We find that the supplier's marketing characteristics (its environmental reputation| brand equity| and advertising) provide it with the countervailing power needed to resist Walmart's appropriation attempts. In contrast| cost-efficient suppliers and suppliers that invest heavily in R&D have more difficulty withstanding Walmart's squeeze attempts. © 2018| American Marketing Association.,1,Financial event study; Power dependence; Retailing; Sustainability; Walmart,

However| prevalent behavioral approaches to sustainability interventions often have the unintended consequence of generating consumer resistance| undermining their effectiveness. With a practice–theoretical perspective| the authors investigate what generates consumer resistance and how it can be reduced| using consumer responses to a nationwide ban on plastic bags in Chile in 2019. The findings show that consumer resistance to sustainability interventions emerges not primarily because consumers are unwilling to change their individual behavior—as the existing literature commonly assumes—but because the individual behaviors being targeted are embedded in dynamic social practices. When sustainability interventions aim to change individual behaviors rather than social practices| they place excessive responsibility on consumers| unsettle their practice-related emotionality| and destabilize the multiple practices that interconnect to shape consumers’ lives| ultimately leading to resistance. The authors propose a theory of consumer resistance in social practice change that explains consumer resistance to sustainability interventions and ways of reducing it. They also offer recommendations for policy makers and social marketers in designing and managing sustainability initiatives that trigger less consumer resistance and thereby foster sustainable consumer behavior. © American Marketing Association 2021.,1,consumer resistance; practice theory; social change; sustainability intervention; sustainable consumer behavior,

This ethnographic study examines the interplay of repair and consumption by analyzing when and how consumers repair the objects they use. The analysis examines how conflicting and complementary practice elements can lead to object replacement and disposal or| alternatively| facilitate object repair and extended use. Results unfold how consumers calibrate their routine activities around the continually changing material capacities of objects. Consumers engage in repair as a response to worn or damaged objects that misalign from and often disrupt ongoing practices. Repairers| including consumers and professional service providers| attempt to adjust object capacities in ways that realign disrupted practices with the routinized ways that consumers do them. When successful| repair sustains consumer practices by avoiding prolonged disruption and unnecessary waste. However| conflicts between production| consumption| and repair can hinder the efficacy of repair interventions and shape whether and how consumers repair the objects they use. The article explains these challenges and concludes by discussing their implications for studies of repair| consumer practices| and sustainable consumption. © 2021 The Author(s).

Prior studies argue that consumer movements primarily seek to challenge these value outcomes by championing alternative higher-order values or by pressuring institutions to change market governance mechanisms. Building on and refining theorization on value regimes| this study illuminates a new type of consumer movement strategy where consumers collaborate to construct alternative object pathways. The study draws from ethnographic fieldwork in the German retail food sector and shows how building alternative object pathways allowed a consumer movement to mitigate the value regime's excessive production of food waste. The revised value regime theorization offers a new and more holistic way of understanding and contextualizing how and where consumer movements mobilize for change. It also provides a new tool for understanding systemic value creation and the role of consumers in such processes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However| little research has investigated or identified the factors that facilitate the successful implementation of environmentally responsible strategies across a network of customer-facing sales units (stores). We propose that a store manager’s ability to lead by example facilitates this process by fostering a supportive climate for store environmental stewardship (SENS-climate). By examining the influence of store managers’ actions on sales associates’ perceptions of the SENS-climate| as well as the subsequent impact on their performance—measured by margins| as well as sales of green and regular products—this study demonstrates that store managers can foster a SENS-climate by articulating their prioritization of environmental responsibility in their operational decisions. These positive effects are sustained by relational factors| such as the moderating effect of the store manager–sales associate dyadic tenure. In contrast| when store managers display high variability in their environmental orientation| it hinders the development of SENS-climate perceptions among sales associates. If sales associates perceive an enabling SENS-climate| they achieve higher margins and more green but fewer regular sales. © 2015| The Author(s).,1,Articulation; Environmental stewardship; Green products; Responsibility; Store climate; Sustainability,

We empirically study the impact of a commonly used nonmonetary incentive— namely| the single-occupancy permission to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes—on green and non-green product demand in the U.S. automobile industry. The HOV incentive could increase unit sales of green vehicles by enhancing their functional value through time saving. On the other hand| the incentive may prove counterproductive if it reduces the symbolic value (i.e.| signaling a proenvironmental image) consumers derive from green vehicles. Assessing the effectiveness of green-product incentives is challenging| given the endogenous nature of governments’ incentive provisions. To identify the effect of the HOV incentive on unit sales of green and non-green vehicles| we take advantage of HOV-incentive changes in two states| and we employ a multitude of quasi-experimental methods using a data set at the county–model–month level. Unlike previous studies that only examine the launch of the HOV incentive and find an insignificant association be-tween incentive launch and green-vehicle demand| we concentrate on its termination. We find that the termination of the HOV incentive decreases unit sales of vehicles covered by the incentive by 14.4%. We provide suggestive evidence that this significant negative effect of HOV-incentive termination is due to the elimination of the functional value the incentive provides: time saving. Specifically| we find that the negative effect is more pronounced in counties where consumers value time saving more (i.e.| counties with a longer commute to work and higher income). Additionally| in line with prior literature| the launch of the HOV incentive is not found to have a significant effect on green-vehicle sales. Combined| our findings reveal that the effect of termination is not simply the opposite of that of launch| implying that governments’ green-product incentives could backfire. © 2020 INFORMS.,1,Climate change; Coarsened exact matching; Difference-in-differences; Government incentives; Green products; Policy evaluation; Public policy; Quasi-experiments; Sustainability; Technology adoption,

Across six studies| we demonstrate that the six-item measure we develop (i.e.| the GREEN scale) can be used to capture green consumption values in a reliable| valid| and parsimonious manner. We further theorize and empirically demonstrate that green consumption values are part of a larger nomological network associated with conservation of not just environmental resources but also personal financial and physical resources. Finally| we demonstrate that the GREEN scale predicts consumer preference for environmentally friendly products. In doing so| we demonstrate that stronger green consumption values increase preference for environmentally friendly products through more favorable evaluations of the non-environmental attributes of these products.

Our analysis connects the existence of socially responsible innovations to the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic social responsibility preferences. In addition to deriving economic value from the product| consumers have heterogeneous intrinsic needs to consume products that are socially responsible. They also have extrinsic social comparison preferences that are based on their meetings with others in social interactions. The frequency of these meetings are endogenous to the consumption choices of consumers. A consumer enjoys a social comparison benefit if her consumption decision is more socially responsible than the consumer that she meets in a social interaction and a social comparison cost if it is less socially responsible. The analysis reveals a nonmonotonic effect of social comparison effects on innovation incentives. When the economic value of a product is relatively small| the incentive to innovate decreases as social comparison effects increase. By contrast| when the economic value of a product is sufficiently large| increases in social comparison effects increase the incentive to innovate. Social comparison benefits and costs have different effects on competition between firms. In particular| social comparison benefits soften price competition| whereas social comparison costs tend to exacerbate price competition. We also identify market conditions where a monopoly invests more or less compared to a firm facing competition. © 2016 INFORMS.,1,Altruism; Competitive strategy; Innovation; R&D strategy; Social comparison; Social responsibility; Sustainability,

In study 1| persuasive appeals consistent with individualizing and binding moral foundations were developed to enhance liberal and conservative recycling. In study 2| individualizing and binding appeals were tested on actual recycling behavior using a longitudinal field study to demonstrate the effectiveness of messages congruent with the moral foundations of liberals and conservatives. Study 3 demonstrated that enhanced fluency represents the underlying psychological process that mediates the relationship between message congruence and intentions. Moreover| study 3 established that spillover effects resulting from increased intentions to engage in sustainable disposition behavior enhance intentions to engage in sustainable acquisition and consumption behaviors.

Yet the literature reports mixed results on the product development effectiveness outcomes of sustainable product development strategies| while scant research has investigated how companies integrate environmental aspects into product development. This study develops a model that integrates effectiveness-enhancing outcomes and organizational inputs of eco-friendly product development strategies. Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple industries| supplemented with lagged primary product development performance data| we find that top management commitment and corporate environmental support policies can facilitate eco-friendly product development strategies| while environmental performance incentives do not. In turn| the adoption of such strategies has a positive effect on firms’ product development effectiveness.

Seven experiments| including two conducted in the field| demonstrate that “ugly” labeling corrects for consumers’ biased expectations regarding key attributes of unattractive produce—particularly tastiness—and thus increases purchase likelihood. “Ugly” labeling is most effective when associated with moderate (rather than steep) price discounts.

This article introduces a novel brand accountability–based framework of consumer response to CSR initiatives| which categorizes CSR efforts as “corrective|” “compensating|” or “cultivating goodwill.” Leveraging a database of CSR press releases by leading consumer packaged goods brands| the authors examine the effect of the different types of CSR announcements on brand sales. The findings suggest that CSR initiatives that genuinely aim to reduce a brand's negative externalities (“corrective” and “compensating”) lift sales| whereas CSR actions focused on philanthropy (“cultivating goodwill”) can hurt sales. The authors propose two moderators—CSR reputation and CSR focus on environmental or social causes—and a mechanism for these effects| which they examine under controlled experimental settings. The experimental results show that| conditional on CSR reputation| consumers perceive varying degrees of sincerity in the different CSR types and that sincerity mediates the effect of CSR type on purchase intentions. Overall| the results suggest that consumers are more inclined to reward firms that directly reduce the negative by-products of their own business practices than to be impressed by public goodwill gestures. © American Marketing Association 2021.,1,brand sincerity; corporate social responsibility; CSR reputation; environmental initiatives; social initiatives; sustainability,

One possible explanation for this value-action gap is the tradeoffs that green products often force on their users: higher prices| lower quality| and/or reduced performance. The current study uses conjoint analysis to uncover the attribute preferences of car and TV buyers when green attributes are negatively correlated with conventional attributes. These attribute preferences are then used to predict choice among sets of green and less green alternatives currently sold in the marketplace. Strong preferences for green products are found when tradeoffs are not apparent| but preference shifts significantly to less green compromise alternatives when the actual attribute tradeoffs are considered. Although general preference is reduced by tradeoffs| a green product offering some compensatory advantage on a conventional attribute does attract a broader spectrum of consumers| while only ""dark green"" consumers are willing to pay the price to go green when the product offers few compensatory qualities. In all cases| however| predicted buyers of the greenest technologies offset some of their environmental benefits by choosing more energy-thirsty specifications on negatively correlated conventional attributes.

This effect reverses| however| with positive ethical production (e.g.| recycled materials). Because consumers have direct responsibility for whether a product is made| feelings of anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of the production process.

They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways| including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior| self-accountability priming| and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore| they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally| they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt| beyond the effects of impression management.

Because consumers want to avoid emotionally difficult ethical information (e.g.| child labor) but believe they should remember it in order to do the right thing| the presence of negative ethical information in a choice or evaluation produces conflict between the want and should selves. Consumers resolve this conflict by letting the want self prevail and forgetting or misremembering the negative ethical information. A series of studies establishes the willfully ignorant memory effect| shows that it holds only for ethical attributes and not for other attributes| and provides process evidence that it is driven by consumers allowing the want self to prevail in order to avoid negative feelings associated with the conflict. We also ameliorate the effect by reducing the amount of pressure exerted by the should self. Lastly| we demonstrate that consumers judge forgetting negative ethical information as more morally acceptable than remembering but ignoring it| suggesting that willfully ignorant memory is a more morally acceptable form of coping with want/should conflict. © 2017 The Author.

Six studies examine the sustainability of high-end products| investigate consumers’ decision making when considering high-end versus ordinary goods| and identify effective marketing strategies to emphasize product durability| an important and valued dimension of sustainable consumption. Real-world data on new and secondhand accessories demonstrate that high-end goods can be more sustainable than mid-range products because they have a longer life cycle. Furthermore| consumers engage in more sustainable behaviors with high-end goods| owning them for longer and disposing of them in more environmentally friendly manners. Nevertheless| many consumers prefer to concentrate their budget on multiple ordinary goods in lieu of fewer high-end products partly because of product durability neglect| a failure to consider how long a product will last.

In this research| the authors explore how a consumer’s global–local identity can affect consumer engagement with a global brand’s environmental sustainability initiative. Specifically| they examine consumer engagement in response to environmental messaging based on regulatory focus| spatial construal| and temporal construal. They theorize and find| across six experimental studies| that consumers with a strong global identity are more engaged with environmental sustainability initiatives when messaging includes frames congruent with their global identity| specifically promotion frames coupled with distant spatial frames and with proximal temporal frames. For consumers with a local identity| these regulatory and construal messaging frames do not impact consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives. Consumer environmental mindset mediates the effect of global–local identity on consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives when such congruent frames are used| and consumer eagerness to act provides additional process explanation for the asymmetric spatial (distant) and temporal (proximal) construal effects.

The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result| consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option| and more strikingly| this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero.

Further| the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand).

Five experiments in actual consumption settings revealed that using a green (vs. conventional) product enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience| referred to as the greenconsumption effect. Merely using a green product makes consumers perceive an increase in the extent to which they are valued as individuals by society| which leads to warm glow feelings| and consequently enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience.

Although the benefits of RBF are varied| some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits| such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF| those associations can generate negative mental imagery| which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present| demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process| with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively| this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations| such as the color green| consumer demand for RBF diminishes.

This research proposes that product transformation salience (thinking about recyclables turning into new products) increases recycling. The authors theorize that consumers are inspired by the transformation of recyclables into new products and that this inspiration motivates them to recycle. The authors demonstrate the effect of product transformation messages on recycling behavior using a recycling campaign (Study 1) and advertisements for products made from recycled plastic (Study 2). Study 3 demonstrates the mediating role of inspiration. Then| three field studies provide robust support for the transformation salience effect through click-through rates for recycling advertisements (Study 4)| recycling rates during pre–football game tailgating (Study 5)| and a reduction in the amount of recyclable materials incorrectly placed in the landfill bin by students in a university residence hall (Study 6). The authors discuss implications for the design of recycling campaigns and positioning of recycled products in the marketplace as well as theoretical contributions regarding the roles of transformation salience and inspiration in encouraging recycling and other sustainable behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2019.,1,inspiration; product transformation salience; recycling; sustainability; waste audit,

Across one field study and three laboratory studies| the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated| injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective| whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated| self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers| marketers| and public policy makers. © 2013| American Marketing Association.",1,Collective self; Descriptive norms; Individual self; Injunctive norms; Normative appeals; Sustainability,

Across six studies| we find a curvilinear effect of social class on green consumption| with the middle class having greater propensity for green consumption compared to the lower and upper classes. This effect can be explained by tension between need for assimilation (NFA) and need for differentiation (NFD) that varies among the three social classes in establishing their optimally distinctive identities. The lower class has a dominant NFA| the upper class has a dominant NFD| and the middle class has dual motivation for assimilation and differentiation. Concomitantly| green consumption has the dual function of assimilation and differentiation. The middle class perceives green consumption as simultaneously assimilating and differentiating| which satisfies their dual motivation and enhances their propensity for green consumption. By contrast| the lower class perceives the differentiation function of green consumption as contradicting their dominant NFA| and the upper class perceives the assimilation function as contradicting their dominant NFD| which lower both their propensities for green consumption. Furthermore| these effects are moderated by consumers' power distance belief. These novel findings have significant theoretical and practical implications on building a more sustainable society. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The authors investigate the role of online social media tools in alleviating customer (farmer) uncertainty and promoting the adoption of a new eco-friendly pesticide in rural China via a randomized controlled field experiment. The key finding is that even for a new product such as a pesticide| a low-cost social media support platform can effectively promote adoption. A combination of information from peers and from the firm on the platform facilitates learning about product features and alleviates uncertainty associated with product quality and appropriate product usage. Nevertheless| at the trial stage of the funnel| the platform underperforms the firm’s customized one-on-one support because available information does not resolve uncertainty in supplier credibility and product authenticity. Having an influencer on the platform| albeit not an expert on this product| vouching for its credibility helps resolve this funnel-holdup problem. From a theoretical perspective| this paper provides suggestive evidence for referent influence and credibility signaling on social media platforms and consequences for new product trial. The authors also provide direct empirical evidence on how information facilitates learning| a phenomenon typically assumed to be present in studies estimating learning models. © The Author(s) 2021.,1,eco-friendly; emerging markets; field experiment; innovation adoption; mobile marketing; social media; sustainability,

The effect of willful ignorance on judgments of others,2016,Journal of Consumer Psychology,26,3,337,349,12,40,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949257212&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcps.2015.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=f72009b39e9fedc61a885b26f63a0622,This research shows that consumers who willfully ignore ethical product attributes denigrate other| more ethical consumers who seek out and use this information in making purchase decisions. Across three studies| willfully ignorant consumers negatively judge ethical others they have never met across various disparate personality traits (e.g.| fashionable| boring). The denigration arises from the self-threat inherent in negative social comparison with others who acted ethically instead of choosing not to do so. In addition| this denigration has detrimental downstream consequences| undermining the denigrator's commitment to ethical values| as evidenced by reduced anger toward firms who violate the ethical principle in question and reduced intention to behave ethically in the future. There are two moderators of the effect: Denigration becomes less strong if willfully ignorant consumers have a second opportunity to act ethically after initially ignoring the ethical product information and also significantly weakens if initially ignoring the ethical attribute is seen as justifiable. These results have implications for understanding ethical consumption behavior| perceptions of ethical consumerism in general| and marketing of ethical products. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.,1,Ethical attributes; Ethical consumer behavior; Morality; Social comparison; Sustainability; Willful ignorance,
