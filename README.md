### An interactive & filterable radial chart for an academic research project

Live site: https://a-vo-sp.netlify.app/

There are two goals to this interactive website, both built around a novel circular/radial Research Map:
1. Enable users to identify trends and gaps through filtering by various aspects (Year, Author, Journal Type, Dimensions), so as to understand the research field better through visual representation on the Research Map.
2. Users are able to answer an embedded survey to place their own work/ideas on the Research Map. 

The Research Map concerns sustainability research, and the academic team developed it by conducting a meta-review of the literature, followed up with a quantitative content analysis of empirical work in the field. 
The Map is built on three dimensions and each datapoint on the Research Map is one of 42 empirical papers.
